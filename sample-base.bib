abstract = {The organized flight of birds is one of the most easily observed, yet challenging to study, phenomena in biology. Birds that fly in organized groups generally do so in one of two fashions: Line formations and Cluster formations. The former groups are typical of large birds such as waterfowl, where birds fly arranged in single lines, often joined together. The scientific questions about these groups usually involve potential adaptive functions, such as why geese fly in a V. Cluster formations are typically made up of large numbers of smaller birds such as pigeons or starlings flying in more irregular arrangements that have a strong three-dimensional character. The groups are defined by synchronized and apparently simultaneous rapid changes in direction. Scientific questions about these groups are usually concerned with mechanism such as how synchrony is achieved. Although field observations about the phenomenon date to the origins of natural history, experimental studies did not begin until the 1970s. Early experimenters and theoreticians were primarily biologists, but more recently aeronautical engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists and, currently, physicists have been attracted to the study of organized flight. Computer modelling has recently generated striking visual representations of organized flight and a number of hypotheses about its functions and mechanisms, but the ability to test these hypotheses lags behind the capacity to generate them. We suggest that a multi disciplinary approach to the phenomenon will be necessary to resolve apparently conflicting current hypotheses.}

abstract = {The modelling of crowd evacuation from a building has been studied over the past decades. In this study, a numerical model based on cellular automaton is proposed to simulate the human behaviour termed “flow with the stream” in emergency evacuation from a large smoke-filled compartment. In the model, the smoke effect in the context of visibility is considered since visibility range can affect the human behaviour significantly. To simulate the reality that the smoke concentration in a fire compartment is not constant, the proposed model is developed to deal with the scenario in which the visibility range varies in the course of time. An empirical formula is incorporated into the proposed model to estimate the visibility range. The results of numerical tests show that the proposed model can also be used to investigate the effect of the number of guiders through case study.}

abstract = {As a collective and highly dynamic social group, the human crowd is a fascinating phenomenon that has been frequently studied by experts from various areas. Recently, computer-based modeling and simulation technologies have emerged to support investigation of the dynamics of crowds, such as a crowd's behaviors under normal and emergent situations. This article assesses the major existing technologies for crowd modeling and simulation. We first propose a two-dimensional categorization mechanism to classify existing work depending on the size of crowds and the time-scale of the crowd phenomena of interest. Four evaluation criteria have also been introduced to evaluate existing crowd simulation systems from the point of view of both a modeler and an end-user.We have discussed some influential existing work in crowd modeling and simulation regarding their major features, performance as well as the technologies used in this work. We have also discussed some open problems in the area. This article will provide the researchers with useful information and insights on the state of the art of the technologies in crowd modeling and simulation as well as future research directions.},

abstract = {The last decades, crowd simulation for crisis management is highlighted as an important topic of interest for many scientific fields. As the continuous evolution of computational resources increases, along with the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence, the demand for better and more realistic simulation has become more attractive and popular to scientists. Along those years, there have been published hundreds of research articles and numerous different systems have been created that aim to simulate crowd behaviors, crisis cases and emergency evacuation scenarios. For better outcomes, recent research has focused on the separation of the problem of crisis management, to multiple research sub-fields (categories), such as the navigation of the simulated pedestrians, their psychology, group dynamics etc. There have been extended research works suggesting new methods and techniques for those categories of problems. In this paper, we propose three main research categories, each one consisting of several sub-categories, relying on crowd simulation for crisis management aspects and we present the outcomes of the last decade, focusing mostly on works exploiting multi-agent technologies. We analyze a number of technologies, methodologies, techniques, tools and systems introduced throughout the last years. A comparative review and discussion of the proposed categories is presented toward the identification of the most efficient aspects of the proposed categories. A general framework toward the future crowd simulation for crisis management is presented to yield the most realistic outcomes. The paper is concluded with some highlights and open questions for future directions.}
